#I HAVE A PROBLEM

That problem is never actually finishing redoing my damn website. Then getting bored of it and starting again from scratch.

##sounds irritating

It is. I've been through endless frameworks, libraries, templates, standard wordpress themes which I just had to edit but I'm never happy. Never finished.

##so what's this one then?

Based on the html5blank-stable theme for wordpress, mainly so I don't have to do a lot of heavy lifting WP wise.

Using Shards html framework/template/theme whatever we're calling it these days.

##gonna finish this one?

Probably not tbh. But I have hope. Endless endless hope.
