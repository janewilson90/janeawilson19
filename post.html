            <p>With every boundary that is pushed – there will always be people saying you’ve gone too far. Smartphones are ruining conversations, facial recognition is destroying privacy, and AI is going to take over the world.</p>
          
            <p>While most of these fears never come into being, the power of a lot of these fledgeling technologies in the wrong hands can do a lot of harm. AI has a relatively long history of not being particularly unbiased when it comes to women, especially when it comes to women of colour. Facial recognition programs frequently have higher error rates with female faces than male and significantly <a href="https://time.com/5520558/artificial-intelligence-racial-gender-bias/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="higher errors (opens in a new tab)">higher errors</a> with women of colour. While this might not seem like a big deal, when you consider that these models are trained on information supplied to them shows that while the AI is biased, it gets that from us.</p>

            </figure>
                    
            <p>Part of this stems from women not being represented. Without having a seat at the table, it’s no wonder that these mistakes are made. While ideally, a room full of men would have the wherewithal to think ‘hmm better pop some pictures of women in there’, it would be a lot better if women were represented.</p>
                    
            <h2>Making fake nudes</h2>
                    
            <p>Speaking of rooms which don’t have female representation – whoever made this definitely made it without consulting anyone else. At all. Ever.</p>
                    
            <p>Some guy who probably thinks he’s very smart has made a web app (also available on Windows and Linux) which can make <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2019/06/27/this-repulsive-app-generates-nudes-from-photos-of-clothed-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">any woman nude</a>. Any unsuspecting, unconsenting, unaware women. You do have to pay $50 to remove the watermark from the image.</p>
                    
            <p>Now, for anyone who isn’t sure why this is a terrible thing let me explain. This app gives anyone the power to create a fake nude picture of a woman (just women, doesn’t work on men) and then distribute it. All without the woman’s knowledge or consent. It would be naive to think this won’t happen. Nudes are leaked every single day and revenge porn is everywhere. And on top of that, women are blamed. Blamed for taking the picture, for sending it to their partner, for not having 2FA enabled. And now blamed for… posting a fully clothed image? </p>

            <p>He’s not wrong, the technology exists so someone probably would have made it. The problem isn’t that it was made (although jesus christ), its that it was created without any thought about the harm which could be done. ‘Alberto’ (as he wants to be known as) didn’t even seem to think that his app <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzm59x/deepnude-app-creates-fake-nudes-of-any-woman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="WHICH MAKE NUDES OF WOMEN WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT (opens in a new tab)">WHICH MAKE NUDES OF WOMEN WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT</a> could ever be a bad thing.</p>

            </blockquote>
                    
            <p>So they admit this was done for entertainment rather than their original line of ‘oh we’re trying monetise the algorithm to improve it’. The assumption that an app like this wouldn’t at some point go viral is a bit naive but I can let that slide.</p>

            </blockquote>
                    
            <p>Ok so they’re now downplaying how good the app was. Yes a maxi dress confused it and odd angles threw it for a loop but it was still pretty good at making women appear naked. Without their consent. Also note they have not yet apologised for actually making the app. Or for not realising the impact that something like this could have on a woman’s life.</p>
                    
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">“Despite the safety measures adopted (watermarks) if 500,000 people use it, the probability that people will misuse it is too high. We don’t want to make money this way."</p>

            </blockquote>
                    
            <p>I would argue if you don’t want to make money from an app which creates fake nudes of unconsenting women, you shouldn’t monazite an app which creates fake nudes of unconsenting women. Or, maybe you shouldn’t have made it (and marketed it) in the first place. Also, saying ‘misuse’ implies there’s another use for the app other than ‘make any woman you want naked’. Which there isn’t.</p>
                        
            <p>Also – a watermark isn’t a ‘safety feature’. Its the ploy they used to make people pay to have it removed. In realtiy, women could lose their jobs if a nude of them became public. Could you imagine a teacher having a fake nude spread round a school of them? How many schools/local authorities would back the teacher? Even if it was watermarked. Or the women who could face abuse from their partner or families if a fake nude of them was created.</p>

            <p>Sorry, what. The world is not ready for an app which makes fake nude pictures of unconsenting women. What world is! Gilead?! Where women have no rights or agency and are at the mercy of men who see them as nothing more than objects and accessories! </p>
                    
            <p>Let’s be real. The developers of this app don’t care about women. They describe the app as ‘The super power you always wanted’. This wasn’t a fun way to experiment with AI or a way for them to drive research into the field. It was a blatant power play by the developers. They see no issue in creating these fake nudes. To them, its just a bit of fun. Grap a picture of your ex-girlfriend and make her naked. Then you’ve got that picture forever! And you can do whatever you want with it. That sure showed her right?</p>
                    
            <div class="wp-block-image">

            <h2>Responsibility</h2>
                    
            <p>In their non-apology, the developers are trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility from the very real harm that their app does. It’s not their fault if someone makes the nude of someone and shares it. That’s not the developers fault! They couldn’t possibly know what would be done with the app that makes nudes of unconsenting women. </p>
                    
            <p>Bull crap. They are responsible. Not wholly, but partially. Yes ultimately its the fault of the person creating and sharing the fake nude. But when you give a person the tools, you have a level of responsibility.</p>
                    
            <p>There will be copies of DeepNude. You can’t put the stopper back on the bottle. As AI’s get smarter and frameworks get better, it’ll become easier and easier for these sorts of apps to be made and there won’t be a shortage of people who will make them. All we can do is keep rejecting these apps. Keep writing articles damming them and their creators. Keep educating people as to *why* these apps are terrible and the very real harm that they can cause and keep striving forwards towards equality.</p>
